\opening{Dear recruiter:} 
 
\noindent %PARAGRAPH ONE: State reason for letter, name the position or type 
%of work you are applying for and identify source from  which  you 
%learned   of   the  opening.  (i.e.  Career  Development  Center, 
%newspaper, employment service, personal contact). 
I am submitting my resume for consideration for the software development engineer position advertised in the JOBank database of our university's career center.
 
\noindent %PARAGRAPH  TWO:  Indicate why you are interested in the position, 
%the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you 
%can  do  for  the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain 
%how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate  for 
%the  position.  If  you have practical work experience, point out 
%specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat 
%the  same  information  the reader will find in the resume. Refer 
%the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes 
%your  qualifications,  training,  and experiences. The purpose of 
%this section is to strengthen your resume  by  providing  details 
%which bring your experiences to life. 
I am applying for this position because I think my past experience squarely meets the job requirements of the position. I am always enthralled by solving the real world problems since I was in college. As a Computer Science graduate working on solving real world problems in physical science for years, I have dealt with a variety of scientific problems spanning all kinds of disciplines such as signal processing, 3D geometry, event reconstruction and Monte Carlo simulation. I am good at articulating the problem at hand and developing computer algorithms to solve it. I am also strongly self-motivated to embrace new technologies such as WebGL which are necessary or facilitative for solving problems. %Whatever technology is need during the course, I can pick it up immediately with the clear goal of solving the problem in mind. The design of a SQL database and the setting up of the server from hardware to software for the web-based 3D event display squarely demonstrates my strong intention to achieve the goal by any means.

Needless to say, Amazon, being a Fortune 500 company, confronts numerous real world problems to solve. I believe I can bring my strong problem solving skills to Amazon and make immediate contributions.

\noindent %PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and  indicate  your 
%flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in 
%the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For 
%example,  state that you will be in the city where the company is 
%located on a certain date and would like to set up an  interview. 
%Or,  state  that  you  will  call  on a certain date to set up an 
%interview. End the letter by thanking  the  employer  for  taking 
%time to consider your credentials. 
I would welcome a personal interview to tell you more about my qualifications, as well as what I can do for Amazon. I appreciate your taking the time to review my credentials and experience. Again, thank you for your consideration. 
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
